# Installation

## Stable release

To install `nox-bootstrap`, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install nox-bootstrap
```

or

```bash
conda install -c wpk-nist nox-bootstrap
```

This is the preferred method to install nox-bootstrap, as it will always install
the most recent stable release.
